# Maersk technical assessment - Adel Sakkir 2024

This is a short summary of the solutions for the problems provided in the task, instructions to run files and results of obtained.

1. **Shortest-Path** - "main_sp_part1.py"

This was the instance of the graph provided in "exercise_baseline.json". The shortest path algorithms are developed as methods to the Graph object.
a) Shortest path between any two vertices - graph.shortest_path_source_to_dest(src = 'co', dest = 'wr', export_output = True, show_output = True) \n
b)	Shortest paths to a single vertex from every other vertex - graph.shortest_path_dest_from_all_nodes(dest = 'co', export_output = True, show_output = True)\n
c)	Shortest path from a single vertex to every other vertex - graph.shortest_path_source_to_all_nodes(src = 'co', export_output = True, show_output = True)
d)	Shortest paths between every pair of vertices - graph.shortest_path_all_pairs(export_output = True, show_output = False)

graph.shortest_path_all_pairs(export_output = True, show_output = False)

3. **Constrained Shortest-Path**
4. **Reinforcement Learning based shortest paths**
